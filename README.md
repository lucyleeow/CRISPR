# CRISPR

My scripts for analysing CRISPR screens using the [MAGeCK](https://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/Home/) pipeline. More details on the MAGeCK software can be found in their papers: 

* [Quality control, modeling, and visualization of CRISPR screens with MAGeCK-VISPR](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0843-6)
* [MAGeCK enables robust identification of essential genes from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0554-4)

ROC analysis of the performance of the CRISPR screens were done using the 'core essential gene set version 2 (CEG2)' from [Hart *et al.* 2017](http://www.g3journal.org/content/7/8/2719.supplemental) (Supplemental material, Table S2) and non-essential genes from [Hart *et al.* 2014](http://msb.embopress.org/content/10/7/733#sec-28) (Supplementary Informatiion - Dataset S1).
